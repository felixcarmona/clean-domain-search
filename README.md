# Remove .blog domains from Lean Domain Search

## Overview

[Lean Domain Search](https://leandomainsearch.com) is one of the best websites for finding available domain names, especially for .com domains. However, recently, it started including .blog domains in the search results. This makes the domain search experience frustrating, as many .blog domains are available, but the .com versions you actually want are already taken. And since Lean Domain Search doesnâ€™t offer a way to filter out .blog domains, it becomes tedious to navigate through results filled with irrelevant .blog domains.

This Chrome extension automatically removes .blog domains from the search results, leaving only the available .com domains for you to browse.

## Installation

1. Download the extension.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files.

## Usage

Once installed, visit [Lean Domain Search](https://leandomainsearch.com), and the extension will automatically filter out any .blog domains from the search results, showing only available .com domains.
